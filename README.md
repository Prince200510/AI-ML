# üè° House Price Prediction - Linear Regression

This repo contains my **House Price Prediction Model** using **Linear Regression** as part of my **ML Learning Journey**.  
I have built and improved the model through multiple iterations to enhance accuracy.

## üéØ About the Models
1. **Part 1 - Accuracy 55.68%**  
   - Basic feature engineering with minimal improvements.
   - Simple encoding and no scaling.
   
2. **Part 2 - Accuracy 64.37%**  
   - Improved accuracy using feature scaling and outlier removal.
   - Better preprocessing for higher R¬≤ score.
